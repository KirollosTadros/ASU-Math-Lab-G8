it is a c++ program that reads matrices from a file and make operations on it 
it is a subset from matlab it works as matlab but not all operations are supprorted  
in the next phase we are aiming to make our program support all operation on matrix and make what matlab can do on the matrix  
it is very usefule program as it reads a file and make all operations in a short time
supported operation are :  
addition  
substraction
